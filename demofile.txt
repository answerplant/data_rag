Version ControlNHS England is responsible for the strategic and operational direction of the National HealthService (NHS). It plays a crucial role in driving digital transformation to enhance healthcaredelivery, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making.As part of this transformation, NHS England developed the Unified Data Access Layer (UDAL)—acloud-based secure data environment (SDE) on Azure—to modernise and centralise data access for NHSanalytical teams. This platform replaces the legacy National Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR),a patient-level data repository hosted by Arden & GEM CSU, which historically supportedcommissioning decisions but lacked scalability and efficiency for future demands.The migration to UDAL ensures improved data interoperability, streamlined analytics, and reducedduplication of effort across NHS England.NHS England faced a critical transition: migrating its national analytical teams from the legacyNational Commissioning Data Repository (NCDR)—one of the NHS’s most important and widely used dataplatforms—to UDAL, a newer, more scalable, and future-proofed environment. This migration wasessential to ensuring NHS England’s data infrastructure could support evolving demands and enablegreater efficiency, security, and long-term sustainability.Although UDAL had been developed, adoption was low, and the platform required significantenhancements, optimisations, and a structured migration framework to ensure widespread andeffective use. Recognising the complexity and importance of this transition, NHS England engagedAnswer Digital to:Lead the migration of NHS England analytical teams from NCDR to UDAL, ensuring continuity ofcritical data services while minimising disruption.Optimise and enhance UDAL, identifying and implementing key improvements in functionality, security,and cost-effectiveness to better serve NHS England’s needs.Standardise the migration process, creating a structured and repeatable approach to enable futuretransitions to be faster, smoother, and more scalable.Train NHS England’s analytical teams, equipping them with the knowledge and tools to confidentlyadopt UDAL and maximise its potential.Answer Digital played a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of UDAL, ensuring it became aviable successor to NCDR.
